##Discussion Questions:

Do you think other fields of study/occupations have such inequalities in them as computer science does? Which fields and who do you think would be underrepresented? Why?

When we were younger, did you find that more boys were interested in computers than girls?  Do you think that had changed in the last 10 years? Will the next generation be equally fluent in computers?

President Barack Obama stated:
“One of the things that I really strongly believe in is that we need to have more girls interested in math, science, and engineering. We’ve got half the population that is way underrepresented in those fields and that means that we’ve got a whole bunch of talent ... that is not being encouraged…”

Does it surprise you that this issue has the attention of our President? Will his recognition make people aware and help make changes?

Will the influence of Grace Hopper and the idea of the Red Chair bring more visibility to the issue? Will it encourage more women to study computer science?
